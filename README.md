# Handwritten Character Recognition with Transfer Learning

This project demonstrates a handwritten character recognition system using transfer learning with the VGG19 model and image augmentation techniques. The model's performance was further optimized with hyperparameter tuning to achieve a final accuracy of 91% from a baseline of 68%.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an accurate model for recognizing handwritten characters by leveraging pre-trained deep learning architectures and enhancing the model through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Description

The project began with a custom neural network model for handwritten character recognition, achieving an initial accuracy of 68%. By generating more images using image augmentation, accuracy was improved. Further optimization was achieved using the VGG19 pre-trained model for transfer learning, resulting in an accuracy of 85%. Finally, hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner was used to enhance the modelâ€™s performance to a final accuracy of 91%.

## Features

- **Custom Model Development**: Initial model architecture with 68% accuracy.
- **Image Augmentation**: Techniques applied to generate new training images and improve model generalization.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilized VGG19 pre-trained model to boost accuracy to 85%.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model parameters using Keras Tuner to achieve 91% accuracy.
